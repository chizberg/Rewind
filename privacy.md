# Rewind Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** December 12, 2025

Rewind (“the app”) is built to work without collecting personal data.

## Data we collect
Rewind **does not collect, store, or sell** your personal information.  
We do not run analytics or ad tracking SDKs.

## Location
If you grant Location access, the app uses your **approximate location/region on-device** to:
- center the map and choose the area to browse retro images.

We do **not** store your location and do **not** send it to our own servers (we don’t have any).  
To fetch images, the app sends a **map area (bounds/region)** to the PastVu API so it can return results for that area.

## Favorites (local storage)
Favorites are stored **only on your device** (local storage).  
They are **not** uploaded or shared by the app.

## Third-party service: PastVu
Rewind downloads images and metadata from **PastVu** via their public API. PastVu may process standard network information (e.g., IP address, request logs) as part of providing their service.

PastVu rules: https://docs.pastvu.com/en/rules

## Data sharing
Rewind does not share your data with third parties, except for the requests necessary to retrieve content from PastVu as described above.

## Changes
If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at the same URL with a new effective date.
